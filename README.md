## Building and Deploying Locally

Building and running in your local dev environment is very easy. Be sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [npm](http://npmjs.com/) installed, then follow the directions below.

**1. Clone the source code:**

```
git clone https://github.com/oconnellj2/oconnellj2.github.io.git
```

**2. (Optional) Install the correct node version using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):**

```
nvm install
```

**3. Install development dependencies (Note: Check the `package.json` engine for our tested and supported node versions):**

```
npm install
```

**4. Run a local development server:**

```
npm start
```

**5. The web app is now running at:**

```
http://localhost:3000
```
